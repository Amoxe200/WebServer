Index directive :
    Defines files that will be used as index
    The file name can contain variables
    Files are checked in the specified order
    The last element of the list can be a file with an absolute path EX :
    index index.$geo.html index.0.html /index.html;

Fix this

    - Complete the parsing of the server block 
    - Compleye the parsing of the location block
    - Handle new line and find a way to tokenize the directive and it's value
